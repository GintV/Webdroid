# webdroid
A web/android project

Project, that was developed for university module.

Main project idea was to create a game, that could be played on browser and could be controlled with smart phone.

So we created a simple game, where the goal is to color the biggest amount of screen. 

Game is available at webdroid.cf. To start playing, you need to download and install android application.

Enjoy!
