# webdroid
A web/android project

Project, that was developed for a university module.

The main project idea was to create a game that could be played on a browser and could be controlled with a smart phone.

So we created a simple game where the goal is to color as much space of the screen as possible with you chosen color. 

The game screen is available on webdroid.cf. To start playing, you need to download and install the android application.

Enjoy!
